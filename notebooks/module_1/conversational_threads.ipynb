      "First off, ramen is the ultimate flex, but let’s not let it be your only source of sustenance, fam. You gotta add some veggies or protein to those noodles like you’re trying to impress a date (or just yourself). Chop up a carrot, throw in some spinach, or toss in an egg—voilà, you’ve leveled up your ramen! 🥚🥬\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy drinks? Yikes. They’re like the spicy memes of beverages—great for a quick laugh but can leave you feeling like a hot mess express. Try to swap at least one of those bad boys for water or herbal tea. Your body is a temple, not a frat house dumpster! 💧🏛️\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you’re feeling fancy, check out meal prep. Cook a batch of something (like that vegetarian lasagna you were thinking about) when you're not drowning in assignments, and just reheat it throughout the week. Less stress, more yum! 🍝✨\n",

      "And remember, balance is key. Your friend should eat something green at least once a week. Just don’t let that green be the mold growing on the ramen! 🤢 \n",
