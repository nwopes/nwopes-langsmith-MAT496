    "(\"How many hearts does an octopus have?\", \"An octopus has three hearts! Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of the body. Interestingly, the main heart stops beating when they swim, which is why they prefer crawling.\"),\n",

    "(\"How many smell receptors do dogs have compared to humans?\", \"Dogs have about 300 million smell receptors compared to humans who only have about 6 million! This gives them a sense of smell that's roughly 10,000 to 100,000 times better than ours.\"),\n",
    "(\"What's the only food that never spoils?\", \"Honey is the only food that never spoils! Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Its low moisture content and acidic pH prevent bacterial growth.\"),\n",
